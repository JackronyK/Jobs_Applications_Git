## Task 2 

### Main Rules for Point Allocation

1. **Sign-up Points**:
   - Each mentor earns **250 points** for signing up to become a mentor. This is a **one-time allocation**, regardless of how many mentees they mentor.

2. **Mentoring Two Different Mentees**:
   - Each mentor earns **1000 points** for conducting mentorship sessions with at least **two different mentees**.

3. **Session Points per Mentee**:
   - Mentors can earn up to **500 points** per mentee. This is broken down as:
     - **250 points per session**.
     - Mentors must hold **at least two sessions** with the same mentee to earn the full 500 points for that mentee.
     - **Each session must be at least 30 minutes** long to qualify for the 250 points.
     - At least **one session must include job information completion** for the full points allocation.
     - Sessions must be with **the same mentee** to count towards the 500 points per mentee.

### Key Criteria Breakdown

1. **Sign-Up Bonus**:
   - Award 250 points to each mentor upon signing up (only once).
   
2. **Mentorship with Two Mentees**:
   - If a mentor has mentored **at least two different mentees**, they receive an additional **1000 points**.

3. **Per-Mentee Sessions**:
   - Each session with the same mentee that lasts **30 minutes or longer** awards **250 points**.
   - To earn the **maximum of 500 points** for one mentee, the mentor must have:
     - Held **at least two sessions** with that mentee.
     - At least **one session must include job information completion**.

### Further Explanation

- **Session Duration**: If a session is less than 30 minutes, the mentor earns **0 points** for that session.
- **Job Information Requirement**: The mentor must ensure that at least one session with a mentee includes the completion of job information. Without this, they wonâ€™t qualify for the full 500 points for that mentee.
